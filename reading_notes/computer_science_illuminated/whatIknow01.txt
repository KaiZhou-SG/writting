  The history of a computer system

  My memory is not clear, what I know is, the computer only has a short 
history. The computer showed its power during World War II, and it was
used by the British to decode the German army codes.
  Before that, the computer was already been investigated by the westerners.
And on the early days, Unix is a popular OS, but it is proprietary software.
Stallman wanted all people are able to share their software, created GNU.
GNU is a collection of opensource software, but GNU has no kernel.
  Linus created a draft of kernel, which was compatible with GNU applications.
And the community improved the kernel, and plant the GNU applications upon it.
The Linux operating system was born.
