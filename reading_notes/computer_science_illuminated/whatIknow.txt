What have I already known about computer science?

  When taking computer science as a discipline in school, we will usually learn 
these topics:
  1) The history of the hardware of a computer system 
  2) The history of programming
  3) The history of computer network
  4) The history of computer artificial intelligence.
  While in the real-world, a computer scientist would focus on a specific area,
do some exploration and experimental work. He or she should have a very solid
knowledge of 'talking' to computers efficiently, and is able to make use of 
certain brancheis of mathematics as a tool to analysis the output of the 
computer system.
  As a computer scientist, he or she may be familar with how to investigate a
certain problem in a certain area, with the help of a computer system.
  Howerver, as a software engineer, what I do is basicly:
  1) know how one set of computer system works, including the hardware system
and the software system
  2)
   2.1) analyze the requirement from the customer
   2.2) convert it into technical documents, that's the specification
   2.3) make a design 
   2.4) implement the design
   2.5) debug and test the software
   2.6) deploy the software system and maintain it 

  From the above analysis, I see that a computer scientist and a software
engineer has a more or less the same knowledge base, but working for different
purposes. My focus is still on software engineering area, while knowing what a
computer scientist is doing is also interesting.
