1 what's the dynamic aspect of a system:
  1) dynamic aspect can be defined as the snap shot of the running system at a
 particular moment.
  2) the sequence diagram captures the time sequence of message flow from one
 object to another
  3) the collaboration diagram describes the organization of objects in a syst-
 em taking part in the message flow

2 the following things are to be identified clearly before drawing the interac-
 tion diagram:
  1) objects taking part in the interaction
  2) message flows among the objects
  3) the sequence in which the messages are flowing
  4) object organization

3 the sequence diagram:
  1) the message flow is a method call of an object
  2) no objects organization is described

4 the collaboration diagram
  1) shows the objects organization
  2) uses numbers to indicates how the methods are called one after another

5 where to use interaction diagrams
  1) sequence diagrams are used to capture the order of messages flowing from
 one object to another. And the collaboration diagrams are used to describe the
 structural organization of the objects taking part in the interaction.
  2) Message flow means the sequence of control flow from one object to another
 and structural organization means the visual organization of the elements in a
 system.
