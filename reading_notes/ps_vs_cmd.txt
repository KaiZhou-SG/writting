1 PowerShell exists only since Windows 7.
2 PowerShell is a Windows system administrating tool.
3 The Command Prompt is essentially a copy of all commands from a DOS system, therefore, it 
  cannot access many Windows system administration features, while PowerShell is a new
  environment designed to manage Windows OS.
4 While Linux shells pipe streams of characters(text), PowerShell pipes objects between 
  cmdlets.
