  I need to make reading notes to:
    1) grasp the critical points of what I read, so that I don't need to read
   the original book or article from beginning till end again, thus, I save
   time
    2) force me to think and understand what the book or article is trying to
   say, and how are the points / concepts organized
    3) force me to repeat what I've understood in my own words
  So the best way to make reading notes are:
    1) before start reading, writing down my ideas of the topic:
      a) what do I think about this topic
      b) how much do I already know about this topic
      c) what do I want to konw about this topic
    2) don't make notes yet for the first time of reading, make the reading
  experience fluently, and a lot of fun
    3) read the article or chapter the second time carefully, and make notes
    4) modify notes
  And the last but not least thing is, do remember to review the notes from
 time to time, thus, to gain what I've paid.
