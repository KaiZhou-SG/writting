1 Web server:
 A Microsoft Server is a unified web platform that integrates IIS, ASP.NET, WCF and   
 Windows SharePoint Services.
2 IIS lets you share information with users on the Internet, an intranet, or an
 extranet.
3 In IIS7, you create sites, applications, and virtual directories to share information
 with users. Sites, applications, and virtual directories work together in a hierarchical
 relationship as the basic building blocks for hosting online content.
4 Sites:
 A site is a container for Web applications, and you can access it through one or more
 unique bindings. A web site binding is the combination of an IP address, a port, and
 the optional host headers on which HTTP.sys listens for requests made to that web site.
5 Applications:
 An application is a software program that runs in an application pool and that delivers
 Web content, usually in HTML, to users over the HTTP protocol. When you create an 
 application, the application's name becomes part of the site's URL that users can
 request from a Web browser.
6 Virtual directories:
 A virtual directory is a directory name that you specify in IIS, and maps to a physical
 directory on a local or remote server. The directory name then becomes part of the 
 application's URL, and users can request the URL from a Web browser to access content
 in the physical directory, such as a web page or a list of additional directories and
 files.
 In IIS 7, each application must have a virtual directory, which is named the root
 directory, and which maps the application to the physical directory that contains
 the application's content.
 An application can have more than one virtual directory.
