  This is a record of my thinking process this morning:
  Well, as I experienced, that a man should be realistic so that he is not
walking in the air, he will do actual good to his life.
  But it's not enough of being realistic, realistic has
limitations, besides, a man has to have a soul which is essential and
super-realistic. 
  The problem is how to master the two factors?
  Of course I can't be just realistic nor just religion-based(super-realistic).
  The problem of been religion is that, religious is a sprit state that
always ethic, it's always about right or wrong. But who's the one to define
right and wrong? Am I going to follow something external to live my life? Of 
course not. Do I just adopt to the realistic, neither.
  Then I thought I should believe in myself, I should believe there is a proper
combination of realistic and religion within myself. What I have to do is to
recall the true self, and let it grow, it's not about right nor wrong, it's not
about successful nor failure.
  And I though of a famous Japanese fighting game player once said after failing
an important match:"I don't 
feel losing, I just want to express myself. If I want to win, I would play a
more powerful role. The role I played is not so strong, and I failed. But
I don't feel losing, because that role I have played expressed myself well."
  Finally I realised: that I should not be afraid of being wrong nor failing,
but been not able to be myself and to express myself.
