  On reviewing this installation log, I feel it's crucial to pocess the ability
to manage the packages in the system.
  For now, I try to make use of the package manage service Ubuntu provides, 
such as in Synaptic, I look for corresponding packages which are certified with
a Ubuntu icon. This trick usually works, and it's safe so far.
  In future, I need to learn further on how to manage packages, plus, how to 
manage access rights to those packages.

1 under virtualenv folder env, installed django-cms, successfully, message:
Successfully installed Django-1.7.8 django-classy-tags-0.6.1 django-cms-3.1.0 django-sekizai-0.8.1 django-treebeard-3.0 djangocms-admin-style-0.2.5 html5lib-0.99999 six-1.9.0

2 reinstall virtual env : success message:

wnloading/unpacking virtualenv

Successfully installed virtualenv

3 I always got errors while executing: djangocms -p ./mypages mysite.
  (1) I observed that the program looks for django-admin in /user/bin, but 
cannot find it. So I searched on my local disk where my django-admin is.
And I found it's located at /user/local/bin.
    So I guess it was because I installed virtualenv via sudo. So I uninstalled
virtualenv, and reinstall it without sudo.
    Now the pgraom can find django-admin, but pops up another error. The Pillow
libirary had some unknown errors. I tried, but could not find a clue on what it
was.
  Finally I went to django-cms official website, followed the simple 
instructions there, and the same error occurred. Since the commands of the 
official site also failed, I think it was some problem on my own pc.
  I did a google search on 'install django-cms failed', and the results lead
me to a 'Libraries installation issues' page. There I found that the Pillow 
library is the common issue. So I tired to install Pillow manually which was
originally handled by pip install djangocms-installer command.
  Now the error came out again, yes, it's the problem with installing Pillow
library, and the error description is clear now: I don't have Python.h file.
Then I googled on 'Python.h missing', and I found a link which provides a 
good solution on how to install python development libraries. 
  Have done that, my libriaries(references) in the virtual environment is
built successfully.
  Now here comes another problem, the complain says that the Pillow library
is not compiled with PNG support.
  OK, I'm going to find a way to compile Pillow with PNG support.

>> Update goes here
  As said before, I still got error with Pillow library, the djangocms-installer
complaint that the Pillow library is not compiled with PNG and JPEG support.
  I looked at the 'Libraries installation issues' page carefully, and concluded
that I may ask for help from Synaptic, it is hard to compile Pillow with PNG
and JPEG support by myself.
  I then observed carefully any clue provided by the 'Libraries installation
issue' page, and got the idea that I my keyword would by Pillow, and searched
Pillow in Synaptic. There are only 4 results, and are marked with a Ubuntu
icon, which means they are save to install. I installed all of them(after
viewing the details of each of them).
  And I reinstalled djangocms-installer, recompiled Pillow, and I got another
error, this time, it's database related: MySql-Python library is missing.
  I've already prepared for that, so I go to Synaptic to search MySql-Python,
and installed all related pacakges. I uninstalled djangocms, removed Pillow,
and uninstalled virtualenv. Restart my Ubuntu.
  After restart, I installed virtualenv first, then djangocms-installer, and
run djangocms -p ./mypages mypages
  All successed!! And the django-cms welcome page is so beautiful, I love it!!
