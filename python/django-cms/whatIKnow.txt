  What have I already known about Content Manage System?

  I'm going to spend the next two years in earth9.com pte ltd, to work on its
CMS applications. So I'm here to learn something about CMS. Before dive into
the ocean of documents, tutorials, I want to summarize what I've already konw.
I'm not a learning machine, I'm not waiting for the ocean of external resources
to fill in my brain. I'm aware what I'm looking for, I'm aware what I'm doing.
  
  The CMS, as I know:

 >>  Content: it's data in various media formats, may it be plain-text files,
images, excel spreadsheets, word documents, database, videos, programs, web
pages, schedule plans, and so on...

 >> Manage: manage not only means retrieve the above content, but also:
  (1) version control the contents(so that changes can be rollback)
  (2) permission control(so that different roles have different access right)
  (3) content editor(so that common users can edit the content without trainnin)
  (4) display(so that the same content can be displayed in different formats
as per the user's preference) 

 >> How to implement a CMS?
 CMS is not a new concept, I'm talking about the WCMS(Web Content Manage System)
now. It needs a web server, and a few front-end applicaitons(such as the
content editor, content conventor and displayer).
  There are lots of CMS frameworks out there. earth9.com pte ltd seemed to
be using ASP.NET. But I find the documentation is so poor that of ASP.NET, as
well as it's so hard to find a good host to host an ASP.NET web application,
which means it's hard to try out, to investigate.
  Instead, I choose django-cms, a free open-source project to learn CMS, and
migrate the concept to ASP.NET when I'm working, that's my plan.
  So basicly I'll use django-cms framework to implement my CMS.

  >> What's the status now?
  I've already installed djangocms-installer on my Ubuntu system, and created
a CMS demo project as well. Which means the environment is ready. Let me get
started now.
