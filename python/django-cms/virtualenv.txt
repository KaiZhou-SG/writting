What I've known about virtualenv so far:

1 It's a program to help the programmer to manage a virtual developing or
deploying environment.

2 Why virtualenv?
  Because we may have different versions of references deployed on our 
machine, and different applications may depend on different versions of those
references. If we update the reference by mistake, we may end up making the
applications depending on it crush. Therefore, we make a virtual environment
for each of the application to debug, to run.

3 How does virtualenv work?
  It's basicly a command-line tool, I can refer to the manual page. What I know
so far, is that it will create some folders for me, and place the required
version of references to the folders accordingly. And the application running
under the virtual environment know where to look for the wanted references.

4 The detailed information goes here:(I'll make notes as I work with it)
