1 Circles and Lines
  There are two kinds of movements in my life: movement in circles and movements in straight lines.
The movement in circles are like: eating, sleeping, thirsty, hungry, curiosity, boring, desperate and 
so on...These movements go round and round, I cannot get rid of them, and each time they return, they
return in the same form.
  Another form of movements is movements in a straight line. Each time I carry on it, it goes further,
and never stops. Such as learning, thinking, logic, and philosophy, arts and so on...
