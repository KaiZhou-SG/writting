1 The core value of a programmer is his or her business value.
2 The core value of a programmer in aspect of technique is his or her logic and
  design of the software.
3 The technical details is really of little value in the real business world. 
4 Therefore, to increase the value as of a programmer, the first thing to do is
  to understand the business the company runs, the second thing is to get
  involved with business logic thinking and designing.
  Simply speaking it's:
  a) a sense of business
  b) logic thinking
  c) skills of software design
5 At first, I try to write as much as I can when creating a technical document.
  After a few times reading others' document and amending mine, I found that
  the value of a technical document is: simple and useful.
  A short document is often better than a long one.
