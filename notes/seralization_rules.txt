These are some serialization rules I discovered while developing web service an application:

1 Need to specify the content type when posting some data to the server, e.g: 
 Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8
 otherwise, the serialization will fail, and the object will be null
2 Only public members are serializable, serialization does not look to the constructors of
 an object, but looks through the public members, and maps the json properties to them one
 by one, case insenstivly.
3 No need to specify the object name in the json data, but need to specify property names:
 {
  "msgHead"
  {
    "type":"emergency",
    "length":"100"
  },
  "msgBody"
  {
    "content":"urgent"
  }
}
 properties need to be separated by ",", but the last property won't have a "," 
4 To be continued...
