1 How does a web page event is triggered and the C# codes at the back end is
called from the front end(web page)?
  1.1 The user works on an HTML control(such as click a button, or a link)
  1.2 The HTML control has its own event attribute(such as onClick). We can
assign a JavaScript method(as an event handler) to it.
  1.3 When the JavaScript method is triggered by the HTML control event, the
JavaScript method is able to invoke public static methods on .cs files.

  >>>>> The Key Point is: the JavaScript method can be assigned to HTML event
  >>>>> attributes, and it can invoke public static methods on .cs files.
