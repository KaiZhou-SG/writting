1 What is Engineering?

2 Features of Engineering.
  2.1 Concepts in Engineering are always there to help me to make things(the
job)easier not harder.
  2.2 If I feel that those concepts are hard to understand, it is because I'm
not clear with the job(the real-world requirement).
  2.3 If I spend some time to understand the real-world problem, it will be
much easier to understand those new concepts, and I will feel very appreciate
of the existance of those concepts.

3 How to do engineering job?
  If I wanna learn some certain engineering technique, the only way is to dive
into the real-world project construction process. Because there is simply no 
'study' in engineering, it's all about constructing. 'Study' means science,
not enginnering.
  Don't use a methodology in the engineering field.
  Don't study theory bit by bit, the purpose of engineering is not study
scientific theory, but solving real-world problems.
  While study a topic benefits engineering, the attitude of 'study' is not
appropriate to do engineering job.
