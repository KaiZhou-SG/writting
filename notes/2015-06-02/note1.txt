Dataflow of an ASP.NET application:

 The flow is:
  >> User trigger UI event >> UI event is handled >> UI is changed

  > User trigger UI control event
  > Control event is handled by a JavaScript function
  > With the help of AjaxPro framework, JavaScript function can invoke C#
   backend codes
  > C# backend codes returns data(e.g. a string in html format) to the
   invoking JavaScript function.
  > JavaScript function change the UI by using the data returned by C# back
   end codes(such as insert a piece of html string to current web page)
