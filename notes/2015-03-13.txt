To all developers who strive for continuous self-improvement
Who are not satisfied with good enough
Who always seek every opportunity to expand their horizons
 and explore the unknown
Whose thirst for knowledge is never fully quenched
Who believe that software development means more than just writing code
Who know that failure is not the end, but merely a step in the journey
Who struggle at times, and sometimes fall, but always get back up again
Who have the will and determination to seek the harder path in life
And, most importantly, who are willing to help others along the way

-- preface of the book: Soft Skills, a life mannual of software engineers
